## Subject Traversal

**Path:** SCREENING → PERIOD_1 → PERIOD_2 → END_OF_STUDY
**Mandatory:** Screening, Day 1, End of Study
**Path:** SCREENING → BASELINE → TREATMENT → WASHOUT → FOLLOW_UP → END_OF_STUDY
**Mandatory:** Screening, Day 1, End of Study

## Endpoint Algorithms

| Type | Name | Algorithm |
|------|------|-----------|
| Exploratory | Exploratory Endpoint 1 | either an increase in pg to >70 mg/dl or... |
| Primary | is to demonstrate that 3 mg LY | either an increase in pg to ≥70 mg/dl or... |

## Derived Variables

| Type | Name | Rule |
|------|------|------|
| ChangeFromBaseline | PG concentrations | the sum of the scores for each question |
| ChangeFromBaseline | concentrations of | post_value - baseline_value |
| Custom | may be | 210 minutes per period/3 = 70 samples pe... |

## Subject State Machine

- **Transitions:** 5
- **Initial:** Screening
- **Terminal:** Completed, Discontinued, Withdrawn, Death, LostToFollowUp

### Transitions

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|----|---------| 
| Screening | Enrolled | Progress from Screening to Enrolled |
| Enrolled | OnTreatment | Progress from Enrolled to OnTreatment |
| OnTreatment | FollowUp | Progress from OnTreatment to FollowUp |
| FollowUp | Completed | Progress from FollowUp to Completed |
| OnTreatment | Discontinued | Discontinuation from treatment |
