    "4. SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA This study can fulfill its objectives only if appropriate subjects are enrolled. The following eligibility criteria are designed to select subjects for whom participation in the study is considered appropriate. All relevant medical and nonmedical conditions should be taken into consideration when deciding whether a particular subject is suitable for this protocol. Subject eligibility should be reviewed and documented by an appropriate member of the investigator\u2019s study team before subjects are included in the study.",
    "1. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document (ICD) indicating that the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.",
    "2. Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, and other study procedures.",
    "3. Expected to be available for the duration of the study and can be contacted by telephone during study participation.",
    "5. Adults determined by clinical assessment, including medical history and clinical judgment, to be eligible for the study, including adults with preexisting stable disease,",

Cohort 1 only: Female subject of nonchildbearing potential or male subject not able to father children; male subject who is able to father children and willing to use a highly effective method of contraception as outlined in this protocol until at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product. Cohorts 2 and 3 only: Female subject of childbearing potential or male subject who is able to father children, and willing to use a highly effective method of contraception as outlined in this protocol for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product; or female subject not of childbearing potential or male subject not able to father children.",
