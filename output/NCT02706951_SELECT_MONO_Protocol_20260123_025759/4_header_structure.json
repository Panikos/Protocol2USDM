    "n. For all women of childbearing potential, collect serum for pregnancy test only at screening. If serum pregnancy test comes back borderline, a repeat test is necessary (pregnancy is an exclusion criterion). Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details.",
    "o. For all women of childbearing potential, collect urine for pregnancy test at Baseline and all subsequent visits. If urine pregnancy test is negative, begin or continue dosing. If urine pregnancy test is positive, withhold dosing and perform a serum pregnancy test. Pregnant subjects must discontinue from study drug. Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details.",
    "p. In Period 1, the central lab hsCRP results starting from Baseline (Day 1) will not be reported to the Sponsor, Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject. For safety evaluations of signs and symptoms of infection and management of adverse events, the investigator may locally test procalcitonin. Results of tests such as hsCRP may be blunted in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, thereby limiting the clinical utility of these tests in the setting of a possible safety assessment or adverse event management. Any local hsCRP or CRP tests should not be reported to the investigator until treatment allocation is unblinded or subject is known to be receiving upadacitinib. In Period 2, the central lab hsCRP results will remain blinded to Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject.",

    "t. Anti-HIV Ab will be performed at Screening, unless prohibited by local regulations. The Investigator must discuss any local reporting requirements to local health agencies with the subject. The site will report confirmed positive results to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary. If a subject has a confirmed positive result, the Investigator must discuss with the subject the potential implications to the subject's health and subject should receive or be referred for clinical care promptly. A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate a positive HIV infection. AbbVie will not receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of any positive result.",
    "u. At Week 2 and Week 4 visits, PK samples should be collected prior to dosing and the subjects should take the study drug dose at the clinic after collecting the PK blood sample. However, if the subject normally takes the study drug dose at a time that is after the time of the scheduled study visit, the subject should follow the regular dosing schedule and the PK sample should be collected at any time during the visit.",
