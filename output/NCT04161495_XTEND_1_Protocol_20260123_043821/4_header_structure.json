    "g. Informed consent from the participant or the participant's legal guardian MUST be obtained prior to any study-related procedures, including washout of current FVIII therapy specifically for entry into the study, or the country's local regulations. Participant assent must also be obtained where applicable (according to the study site's geographic region).",

The washout period prior to BIVV001 Day 1 dose administration for subjects in abbreviated PK sampling may be modified at the discretion of the Investigator based on individual PK data and clinical phenotype in consultation with medical monitor. Washout prior to all other scheduled inhibitor tests must be at least 7\u00b11 days. Inhibitor and ADA samples will be collected prior to BIVV001 dosing. Separate samples for anti-rFVIIIFc-VWF-XTEN antibody (ADA) testing will be collected at the same timepoint when any samples are collected for inhibitor testing (including samples for suspected inhibitor and confirmatory inhibitor tests). All inhibitor assays, including the assay for the Screening Visit and any confirmatory assays, will be performed by the central laboratory using the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay. If a Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay result returns as \u22650.6 BU/mL, a separate sample must be collected and tested for confirmation of inhibitor development within 2 to 4 weeks of the original sample. Testing for potential ADA formation will be performed at a central laboratory using a validated rFVIIIFc-VWF-XTEN-specific ADA assay. Confirmed positive samples will be further characterized for antibodies specific to FVIII, Fc, D'D3, or XTEN.",
    "l. Participants in Arm A will have BIVV001 doses given at each applicable scheduled visit. Participants in Arm B will have BIVV001 doses at visits Day 1, Weeks 26, 39, and 52. During the Scheduled study visits, BIVV001 will be delivered via a slow push IV injection of 8 \u00b12 minutes, at a rate of administration determined by the participant's comfort level. For all BIVV001 injections performed at home BIVV001 will be delivered via a slow push IV injection at a rate of administration determined by the participant's comfort level according to the vial and injection rate recommendations (Table 7). Injection start and stop time will be recorded in the eCRF. Other doses may be self/caregiver administered at home (or in clinic) (Table 3)",
    "m. Vital signs include blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and temperature (\u00b0C). Vital signs should be taken after the participant has been resting supine for 5 minutes. Vital signs will be measured pre-injection and 30 (\u00b115 minutes) from the start of injection at clinic visits. Vital signs should also be taken at any unscheduled visit.",
    "n. Applicable to female participants only. A serum pregnancy test should be performed at screening. For all other time points, the choice of the pregnancy test (urine or serum) is at the discretion of the Investigator. If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (eg, an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant must be excluded from further participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.",
    "o. For participants who have been historically negative, viral testing will be performed at a central laboratory. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tests will include HIV-1 antibodies, HIV-2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) tests will include HBV surface antigen, anti-HBV surface antibody and anti-HBV core antibody. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) tests will include anti-HCV antibodies.",
    "p. For participants known to be HIV antibody positive, CD4 count and viral load tests must be performed at the central laboratory if results are not available from within 26 weeks prior to screening.",
    "q. Hematology parameters include red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count and differential, platelet count, hemoglobin (Hgb), and hematocrit (Hct). Blood samples for hematology analysis will be collected prior to BIVV001 dosing.",
    "r. Clinical chemistry parameters include alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, total protein, sodium, potassium, and chloride. Blood samples for clinical chemistry analysis will be collected prior to BIVV001 dosing.",
    "s. The Von Willebrand comprehensive panel (includes assessments of von Willebrand Factor [VWF] ristocetin cofactor activity and VWF antigen). Blood samples for analysis of Von Willebrand comprehensive panel will be collected prior to any BIVV001 dosing.",
    "t. Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) occurring after signing of the informed consent form (ICF) through the Safety Follow-Up Call or Visit will be recorded on the case report form (CRF). Pain medication related to Hemophilia and administered within 2 weeks prior to the visit will be recorded on the CRF.",
    "u. Prior and concomitant medications from up to 30 days prior to Screening and concomitant therapies and procedures from signing of ICF through the Safety Follow-Up Call or Visit will be recorded on the CRF.",
    "v. In addition to scheduled clinic visits, telephone calls are planned approximately once a month for the site staff to check on each participant's status. During the monthly telephone call, the participant's parent/caregiver will also be reminded about the requirement for timely ePD data entry, and assessments of \"spontaneous\" and \"traumatic\" bleeding episodes will be noted.",
