If patient experiences a hematological breakthrough event, a PK, PD, and ADA sample should be collected at the time of the event.",
    "c. Applicable to patients who do not have documented vaccination against encapsulated bacterial pathogens within 5 years of enrollment. Refer to immunization recommendations per Section 6.1.1.1 for patients requiring vaccination. A blood sample for vaccine titers will be collected on Day 0 prior to study drug infusion to be used to determine serum relevant antibody titers should the patient be diagnosed with an infection associated with an encapsulated organism during the course of the study. A second sample will be collected during the study period if a patient presents with symptoms concerning for an infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis or Haemophilus influenzae and analyzed if the infection is confirmed with one of the aforementioned organisms.",
    "d. Prior bone marrow biopsy report review, prior tissue assessment, or new bone marrow biopsy (as applicable). Sites will submit de-identified biopsy reports to independent central reader for eligibility adjudication. If biopsy is deemed unsuitable or insufficient to determine eligibility, either prior tissue may be submitted for additional hematopathology assessment or a new bone marrow biopsy will be performed during the screening period.",

Serum or urine pregnancy test to be performed on Days 0, 21, 49, 77, 105, 133, and 161, and at Week 26/EOT or at the ET Visit. Repeat serum or urine pregnancy test every 4 weeks (±2 days) during Part B.",

BIVV009 doses of 6.5 grams (if <75 kg) or 7.5 grams (if ≥75 kg) based on patient's baseline body weight will be administered via IV infusion over ~60 ±5 minutes on Days 0, 7, and every 14 days thereafter during Part A, and every 2 weeks starting at Week 27 during Part B. Patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease may receive a 2-hour infusion with Sponsor approval. If a patient misses a scheduled dose (outside of the 2-day window or >17 days since last dose), they must return to site (unscheduled visit) to receive another loading dose 1 week prior to the next scheduled dose. Qualifying patients at participating sites may have study drug dosed at home during certain visits in Part B, according to the rules specified in Section 10.10 Appendix J (US, the Netherlands, Norway, France, Italy, Austria, Germany, Spain, and specific amendments.",

During Part A, PK and PD samples will be collected at predose and 1 hour (±15 minutes) postdose (ie, 1 hour after completion of study drug infusion) from all patients on Days 0, 7, 21, 35, 49, 63, 77, 91, 105, 119, 133, 147, 161, and 175. An additional blood sample for PK and PD analysis will be collected during the EOT visit on Day 182 or at ET if a patient withdraws early. During Part B, PK and PD samples will be collected routinely at 3-month intervals during the 1st year of treatment in Part B, and then at 6-month intervals. PK and PD samples will also be collected if a patient experiences a hematologic breakthrough event at any point during the study.",

    "r. During Part B, ADA samples will be collected at predose at 3-month intervals during the 1st year of treatment in Part B and then at 6-month intervals and at safety follow up visit 9 weeks after last dose. Samples will also be collected if a patient experiences a hematologic breakthrough event or withdraws from the study early.",
