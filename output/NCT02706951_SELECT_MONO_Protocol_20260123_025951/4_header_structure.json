    "a. If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation (withdrawal of informed consent), the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of study drug discontinuation.",
    "b. The Baseline visit procedures will serve as the reference for all subsequent visits with the exception of the ECG which will be obtained at Screening only and used as the baseline reference.",
    "c. This visit is 30 days after last dose of study drug for those subjects who complete Period 1 and do NOT enter Period 2. A 30-day follow-up phone call may be allowed for subjects who have completed PD visit to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs.",
    "d. Informed consent should be obtained at Screening prior to performing any study related procedures.",
    "e. Document herpes zoster and hepatitis B vaccination status in medical history.",
    "f. Collect serious adverse events and protocol-related nonserious AEs that occur after a subject signs the informed consent, prior to the first dose of study drug.",
    "g. Prior to other procedures. For morning stiffness, duration will be captured only if NRS rating is > 0.",
    "h. Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures TB Testing for specific requirements for TB testing and TB prophylaxis.",
    "i. The chest x-ray will not be required if a subject had a previous normal chest-x-ray within 90 days of Screening, provided that all source documentation is available at the site (refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Chest X-Ray for specific requirements).",
    "j. For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at Screening will not be required, provided all source documentation is available. Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 12-Lead ECG for additional details.",
    "k. For subjects who do not enter Period 2 or prematurely discontinue from the study, an ECG will be performed.",
    "l. Blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate should be performed before blood draws are performed.",
    "m. A full physical exam is required at the visits indicated. A symptom-directed physical exam may be performed when necessary.",
    "n. For all women of childbearing potential, collect serum for pregnancy test only at screening. If serum pregnancy test comes back borderline, a repeat test is necessary (pregnancy is an exclusion criterion). Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details.",
    "o. For all women of childbearing potential, collect urine for pregnancy test at Baseline and all subsequent visits. If urine pregnancy test is negative, begin or continue dosing. If urine pregnancy test is positive, withhold dosing and perform a serum pregnancy test. Pregnant subjects must discontinue from study drug. Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details.",
    "p. In Period 1, the central lab hsCRP results starting from Baseline (Day 1) will not be reported to the Sponsor, Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject. For safety evaluations of signs and symptoms of infection and management of adverse events, the investigator may locally test procalcitonin. Results of tests such as hsCRP may be blunted in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, thereby limiting the clinical utility of these tests in the setting of a possible safety assessment or adverse event management. Any local hsCRP or CRP tests should not be reported to the investigator until treatment allocation is unblinded or subject is known to be receiving upadacitinib. In Period 2, the central lab hsCRP results will remain blinded to Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject.",
    "q. Minimum 8-hour fast. If a subject is not able to fast when necessary, due to unforeseen circumstances, the non-fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation.",
    "r. A urine dipstick macroscopic urinalysis will be completed by the central laboratory at all required visits. A microscopic analysis will be performed in the event the dipstick results show leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal.",
    "s. FSH should be tested at Screening if the female subject is < 55 years of age AND has had no menses for \u2265 12 months AND has no history of permanent surgical sterilization (defined in Section 5.2.4).",
    "t. Anti-HIV Ab will be performed at Screening, unless prohibited by local regulations. The Investigator must discuss any local reporting requirements to local health agencies with the subject. The site will report confirmed positive results to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary. If a subject has a confirmed positive result, the Investigator must discuss with the subject the potential implications to the subject's health and subject should receive or be referred for clinical care promptly. A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate a positive HIV infection. AbbVie will not receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of any positive result.",
    "u. At Week 2 and Week 4 visits, PK samples should be collected prior to dosing and the subjects should take the study drug dose at the clinic after collecting the PK blood sample. However, if the subject normally takes the study drug dose at a time that is after the time of the scheduled study visit, the subject should follow the regular dosing schedule and the PK sample should be collected at any time during the visit.",
    "v. PK samples should be collected at any time during the visit. Subject should follow the regular dosing schedule.",
    "w. Samples only collected if subject provides written consent.",
    "x. For subjects entering Period 2.",
    "1. Have you or an immediate family member or other close contact ever been diagnosed or treated for tuberculosis?",
    "2. Have you lived in or had prolonged travels to countries in the following regions: \u25cf Sub-Saharan Africa \u25cf India \u25cf China \u25cf Mexico \u25cf Southeast Asia or Micronesia \u25cf The former Soviet Union",
    "3. Have you lived or worked in a prison, homeless shelter, immigration center, or nursing home?",
    "4. Have you, or an immediate family member, had any of the following problems for the past 3 weeks or longer: \u25cf Chronic Cough \u25cf Production of Sputum \u25cf Blood-Streaked Sputum \u25cf Unexplained Weight Loss \u25cf Fever \u25cf Fatigue/Tiredness \u25cf Night Sweats \u25cf Shortness of Breath From: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/tuberculosis/DS00372/DSECTION=risk-factors http://www.in.gov/fssa/files/Tuberculosis_Questionnaire.pdf obbvie"
